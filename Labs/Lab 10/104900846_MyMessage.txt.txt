I have enjoyed my first term at UWindsor.  I have learned a lot. I am not a computer science
student.  I took this with the intention of transistioning into either computer science 
or electrical engineering and have chosen the later.

This course has set the bar in terms of learn on your own.  
Assignments and labs often contained incorrect descriptions or errors with no indication was
given that this may be the case.
Well this was a frustrating and confusing method to learn from I will begrudingly 
admit it forced me to work towards a greater understanding of what I was doing, 
elsewise credit in this course would have been unacheivable.

From someone who started as a complete noob I am happy with where I ended up.
Obviously I would like to see the midterms and quizzes move slightly more towards
the not impossible level however I am not going to pretend that this course wasn't
hilariously easy for people who could have essentially sat down and done every assignment
and the tests in 24 hours or less (with sufficient amounts of coffee).
I think this course does the best it can within the scope of what it is.
